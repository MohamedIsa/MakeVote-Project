# The Project is free and open source

MakeVote is an open-source platform for secure and reliable online voting that gives groups a place to hold open, accessible, and transparent elections. Our system, which prioritizes security and accessibility, runs under the MIT License. By empowering organizations to design and oversee their own voting events, MakeVote encourages everyone to take part in the democratic process. MakeVote is the collaborative center for digital democracy, whether you are a developer wishing to contribute to democratic technologies or an organization trying to hold fair elections.

# Looking around Other Similar Projects

Before starting an open-source project, we did our own research to find projects that were competitive and similar to ours. Comparable voting platforms consist of:

- [countmein](https://github.com/democracy-tools/countmein)
- [helios-server](https://github.com/benadida/helios-server)
- [democracyos](https://github.com/DemocracyOS/democracyos)
- [vxsuite](https://github.com/votingworks/vxsuite)

We announced a major initiative to defend the vote against attack, aiming at declaring safe zones for voting everywhere and organizing election protection. The way we looked at it, we wanted to cater for the enterprise side of things all the way down to company level and then schools right through NGOs even community groups. We built a full to voting validation and results with features like ballot generation, voter verification etc at protecting the integrity of every vote while providing fast feedback on election results We set out to create an intuitive interface and most complete feature list in order catalyze the democratic process as a whole, increasing voter access.

# Choosing a Good Name

One of the challenges we had as a team was coming up with an acceptable name for the open-source project before it was introduced.One of the challenges we had as a team was coming up with an acceptable name for the open-source project before it was introduced. The project's name should express both its distinctiveness and a broad sense of its goal. Additionally, the project name ought to be easy to remember and distinct from that of other projects.
In order to select a good name, we all decided to vote on the names VoteSphere, MakeVote, BallotHub, and VoteInsight. We also collectively agreed on the name — "MakeVote" is catchy, action-calling and descriptive. When we did that as part of our own research by looking at every repository — ideally, this is what the more advanced text search function should be doing anyway — we realized not many results come up using this term. In our own investigation we also look through all the repositories, but this name gives us few hits.

# Starting from What You Have

In line with the goals of its creators, the MakeVote Web Application has been converted into an open-source platform that is available to everybody.In line with the goals of its creators, the MakeVote Web Application has been converted into an open-source platform that is available to everybody. Since its inception as a project for the ITCS 333 Internet and Web Development course, MakeVote has undergone tremendous development. To ensure cross-platform compatibility, the coding must now be reorganized.

# Developer Guidelines

Welcome to the MakeVote development community! These guidelines are designed to help you participate effectively in the project. Please take a moment to review them before getting started.

### Developer Interaction

All members are expected to follow the community’s documents and guidelines.

While not strict rules, developers are encouraged to communicate via Discord or email. These suggestions aim to improve collaboration, streamline the process, and benefit both the project and individual contributors.

If you have any questions about these guidelines, the MakeVote development team is here to assist.

### Code Format

There should only be one code command per line.
Keep the back slash line between code blocks .

### Code Scope

1. Validate and sanitize all user inputs using PHP functions like filter_var() and htmlspecialchars() to prevent security risks such as SQL injection and XSS.
1. Use try-catch blocks for critical operations and log errors. Ensure user-facing errors are clear without exposing sensitive system details.

### Other Code-Related Information

- Each variable's name should have meant and be pertinent to its intended use.
- There should be a brief statement describing the purpose of each group or block of code.

### Developing Secure Software

Addressing security threats may not be the most thrilling aspect of coding, but it is crucial. Security risk assessments need to start at the beginning of the project and should be ongoing throughout its lifespan.

It is important to comprehend the security risks linked to each part of the project. Avoid depending entirely on default configurations and pre-set software settings.

### Which Programming Language Should I Use?

Regarding programming languages, we don't have any hard regulations. We use JS, CSS, PHP, and HTML now, however we're open to changes for better project outcomes.

### Code Comments

Comments on the code should provide an explanation for its actions.
Make sure your indentation is standardized.
Make use of the horizontal whitespace (code blocks and paragraphs).

### Using the bug Tracker

The recommended method for reporting issues, asking for features, and making pull requests is the bug tracker.

### Feature Requests

Make sure that the project's objectives and extent are in line with your vision. Provide a strong argument to justify the incorporation of the feature.

### Requests for Pulls

Good pull requests include patches, upgrades, and new features.
Aim for focused pull requests and steer clear of irrelevant commits.
Before you begin, find out the scope of the pull request from a maintainer.

### Bug Report

Include the following details:

- Title: Clear and to the point.
- Summary: Provide a detailed explanation.
- Visual Evidence: Attach screenshots or video for context.
- Expected vs. Actual Result: Be brief and clear.
- Reproducible Steps: List the actions that led to the bug.
- Environment: Include OS, browser, screen resolution, and zoom level.
- Console Logs: Identify the error’s source.
- Source URL: Provide the URL for quicker diagnosis.
- Priority and Severity: Specify the impact level and urgency.
- Reporter Info: Include reporter name, recipient, deadline, and communication details with the user.
  Send the completed report to makevoteuob@gmail.com for support.

# Documentation

The complete documentation for the new open-source project is not yet available as the website is still in the early stages of development, as previously mentioned in the development status. If you have the technical skills required for contributing to our project, particularly in server configuration, web development, and security implementation, you should clone the repository, install Apache and MySQL, and then create a new database in phpMyAdmin if you are familiar with version control systems like Git. Before modifying the config.php file, you need to enter your database credentials. Frontend design relies on CSS, but handling the backend functionality requires an understanding of PHP and security best practices.Even though the instructions guide you through the process, users who are already knowledgeable with JavaScript, HTML, PHP, and CSS will find it easier to explore and change MakeVote's frontend. Even though the instructions guide you through the process, users who are already knowledgeable with JavaScript, HTML, PHP, and CSS will find it easier to explore and change MakeVote's frontend.In general, customers that have a basic understanding of web programming fundamentals and cryptographic principles will find it easier to manage the setup and customizing process.
