# The Project is free and open source

MakeVote is an open-source platform for secure and reliable online voting that gives groups a place to hold open, accessible, and transparent elections. Our system, which prioritizes security and accessibility, runs under the MIT License. By empowering organizations to design and oversee their own voting events, MakeVote encourages everyone to take part in the democratic process. MakeVote is the collaborative center for digital democracy, whether you are a developer wishing to contribute to democratic technologies or an organization trying to hold fair elections.

# Looking around Other Similar Projects

Before starting an open-source project, we did our own research to find projects that were competitive and similar to ours. Comparable voting platforms consist of:

- [countmein](https://github.com/democracy-tools/countmein)
- [helios-server](https://github.com/benadida/helios-server)
- [democracyos](https://github.com/DemocracyOS/democracyos)
- [vxsuite](https://github.com/votingworks/vxsuite)

We announced a major initiative to defend the vote against attack, aiming at declaring safe zones for voting everywhere and organizing election protection. The way we looked at it, we wanted to cater for the enterprise side of things all the way down to company level and then schools right through NGOs even community groups. We built a full to voting validation and results with features like ballot generation, voter verification etc at protecting the integrity of every vote while providing fast feedback on election results We set out to create an intuitive interface and most complete feature list in order catalyze the democratic process as a whole, increasing voter access.

# Choosing a Good Name

One of the challenges we had as a team was coming up with an acceptable name for the open-source project before it was introduced.One of the challenges we had as a team was coming up with an acceptable name for the open-source project before it was introduced. The project's name should express both its distinctiveness and a broad sense of its goal. Additionally, the project name ought to be easy to remember and distinct from that of other projects.
In order to select a good name, we all decided to vote on the names VoteSphere, MakeVote, BallotHub, and VoteInsight. We also collectively agreed on the name — "MakeVote" is catchy, action-calling and descriptive. When we did that as part of our own research by looking at every repository — ideally, this is what the more advanced text search function should be doing anyway — we realized not many results come up using this term. In our own investigation we also look through all the repositories, but this name gives us few hits.

# Starting from What You Have

In line with the goals of its creators, the MakeVote Web Application has been converted into an open-source platform that is available to everybody.In line with the goals of its creators, the MakeVote Web Application has been converted into an open-source platform that is available to everybody. Since its inception as a project for the ITCS 333 Internet and Web Development course, MakeVote has undergone tremendous development. To ensure cross-platform compatibility, the coding must now be reorganized.

# Documentation

The complete documentation for the new open-source project is not yet available as the website is still in the early stages of development, as previously mentioned in the development status. If you have the technical skills required for contributing to our project, particularly in server configuration, web development, and security implementation, you should clone the repository, install Apache and MySQL, and then create a new database in phpMyAdmin if you are familiar with version control systems like Git. Before modifying the config.php file, you need to enter your database credentials. Frontend design relies on CSS, but handling the backend functionality requires an understanding of PHP and security best practices.Even though the instructions guide you through the process, users who are already knowledgeable with JavaScript, HTML, PHP, and CSS will find it easier to explore and change MakeVote's frontend.
